Hello there and welcome to my engineer journey/blog/rant/etc... honestly, I don't really know what this is at the moment. All I know is that I enjoy learning and applying what I learn and this blog will document just that.

So let's see, oh yeah! Small intro.

My name is Myles. I'm a Frontend Engineer. I've been one professionally for about 5 years now but I feel like I've been an engineer all my life. From building things with my dad's PVC pipes out in the backyard, to building full on digital interfaces on the web, I've always found it fascinating to learn, break, and rebuild things.

I went to college for computer science, but honestly, didn't care much about it at the time, so just did what I could to get by. Fast foward to now, I'm starting to find software engineering fun and interesting. Not sure why it took so long, but hey, I'm here ready to dig deep a lot of stuff I've put to the side.

So if you're a frontend engineer, or really just an engineer, also starting to find this massive field super interesting, then you'll probably find something cool on this blog. I'm hoping to document topics I don't quite understand, and write my way to learning them. Oh and just a disclaimer, as you've probably already noticed, I'm not much of a writer, so bare with me while I improve that skill as well.

Anyways, welcome and hope you enjoy!
