I'm going to be hoenst, this will probably be an ongoing post since there are too many things to cover in a single post on Astro. If that's the case, maybe I'll turn this into a series or something, idk.

Anyways, I wanted to talk about Astro and how it was using it to build this blog, at least the initial set up that is.

## Installation was a breeze

These days installing a new framwork and getting it going are pretty easy to deal with. So I already had sort of baseline of what Astro should be like. That is, it should:

- not require many commands (cli)
- feel like a turn key type of set up

I can say that Astro, was super simple to set up. 

It was literally:

1. start the setup wizward
```
npm create astro@latest
```

2. run Astro and take off
```
npm run dev
```

With this you were free to go off into space and travel whatever galaxy you wanted to. And if you weren't sure where to start the docs had you covered with their [recipes of ideas](https://docs.astro.build/en/guides/migrate-to-astro/).

## Docs were easy to understand

I loved how the docs were organized. If you've already built with web frameworks, you kind of have an idea of what you need to set up next and Astro had a great way of organizing that into sections in their docs. From basics, to recipes, to full on guides, they organized their docs in a way where I can get to what I need now, in a quick and easy way.

Usually, I find that docs do have everything you need, but they never seem to be organized in these high level buckets like how Astro has done it.

## Had a fun/space vibe going for it
