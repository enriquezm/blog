			<p>
				I'm a coder but I'm also a traveler, aspiring gardener ðŸŒ±, and a professional ice cream eater.
			</p>
			<p>
				Follow me on this blog as I attempt to write about my journey at becoming a master frontend engineer. Spoiler alert! That's basically impossible, but it's still fun trying right?! I also plan on writing about gardening and some other things!
